# AI Model Analysis Plan: Genome-Environment Fitness Prediction

## Goal

Build an interpretable AI model that analyzes and explains **why certain genomes thrive in specific environments** within the evolution simulation. The model should:

1. **Predict** genome fitness in given environments
2. **Understand** which genes matter and why
3. **Explain** genome-environment interactions
4. **Analyze** ecosystem dynamics and niche specialization

## Research Question

**"Why does this genome thrive in this environment?"**

The model should provide interpretable explanations like:
- "Gene 17 (thermal_tolerance) = 0.85 matches desert temperature (0.8), contributing +0.15 to fitness"
- "High foraging_drive (0.92) compensates for low resource density in this environment"
- "This genome's low movement_cost (0.23) allows efficient resource searching in sparse areas"
